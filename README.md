# jRodent

A modern, native, [Gopher](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?a=gopher%3A%2F%2Fgopher.floodgap.com%2F1%2Fgopher)
client for new and old computers.

This is a Java 1.5 port of the [original Win32 application](https://github.com/nathanpc/rodent)
I built 2 years ago.

## Requirements

This application is designed to be as cross-platform as possible and run on as
many old system as Java allows, so all that you are required to have is a
**Java 1.5** runtime environment.

## Motivation

Although the original Rodent application for Windows is almost finished and took
a long time to build, but I wanted to create a version of the application that
would be truly cross-platform and backwards compatible as  to support all the
weird and wonderful devices that I use every single day.
